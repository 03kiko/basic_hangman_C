# Basic_hangman
This program is a simple implementation of the classic game of Hangman in the C programming language. It was developed as a learning exercise to gain familiarity with C and basic programming concepts.

## How to Paly:
The game begins by selecting a random word from a predefined list of words (word bank). The player must then guess the letters of the word, one at a time. The player has 10 attempts to guess the word before "the hangman is fully drawn" and the game is lost.

## Contributing
This program is intended to be a simple learning exercise, but contributions are always welcome. If you have suggestions for improving the game or adding new features, feel free to create a pull request. Additionally, if you would like to add new words to the word bank, you can do so by modifying the words array in the main() function.
